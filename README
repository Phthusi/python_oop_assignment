Create a Python class named Person.
The Person class should have the following attributes:
name: representing the person's name.
age: representing the person's age.
gender: representing the person's gender.
Implement a method called introduce that prints a message introducing the person with their name, age, and gender.
Create an instance of the Person class and call the introduce method to display the person's information.
Create a GitHub repository for your assignment and submit the link.

Objective: Create a custom class representing a real-life entity, initialize it with attributes, 
and add inheritance to explore OOP principles like polymorphism or encapsulation.

Pseudocode
Define a Class
Define a class with a descriptive name (e.g., Smartphone, Book, Superhero).
Add Attributes
Inside the class, define attributes that represent characteristics of the object (e.g., model, color, battery_level for Smartphone).
Add Methods
Define methods to simulate actions or behaviors (e.g., make_call() for a Smartphone).
Create a Constructor
Define a constructor to initialize attributes with unique values when creating an object.
Define a Subclass (Inheritance Layer)
Create a subclass to inherit from the main class.
Add or override methods in the subclass to demonstrate polymorphism or encapsulation.
Initialize Objects
Instantiate objects of the class and subclass with unique values.
